-- Arithmetic Operators
-- Used to perform mathematical calculations.
-- | Operator | Description    | Example       |
-- | -------- | -------------- | ------------- |
-- | `+`      | Addition       | `10 + 5 = 15` |
-- | `-`      | Subtraction    | `10 - 5 = 5`  |
-- | `*`      | Multiplication | `10 * 5 = 50` |
-- | `/`      | Division       | `10 / 5 = 2`  |

-- Logical Operators
-- Used to combine multiple conditions in a SQL query.

-- | Operator | Description                     | Example                          |
-- | -------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
-- | `AND`    | True if all conditions are true | `salary > 5000 AND dept_id = 10` |
-- | `OR`     | True if any condition is true   | `dept_id = 10 OR dept_id = 20`   |
-- | `NOT`    | Reverses the condition's result | `NOT (salary < 5000)`            |

-- Relational Operators
-- Used to compare two values.

-- | Operator     | Description              | Example          |
-- | ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------- |

-- | `!=` or `<>` | Not equal to             | `salary != 5000` |
-- | `>`          | Greater than             | `salary > 5000`  |
-- | `<`          | Less than                | `salary < 5000`  |
-- | `>=`         | Greater than or equal to | `salary >= 5000` |
-- | `<=`         | Less than or equal to    | `salary <= 5000` |

-- Special Operators
-- Used for specific conditions or pattern matching.

-- | Operator  | Description                                      | Example                         |                          |           |   |     |   |          |

-- | `BETWEEN` | Within a range                                   | `salary BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000`  |                          |           |   |     |   |          |
